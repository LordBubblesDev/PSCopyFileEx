SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module for copying files with advanced progress reporting and Windows API support.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSCopyFileEx is a PowerShell module that provides enhanced file copy capabilities with
    detailed progress reporting. It leverages the Windows CopyFileEx API when available
    and falls back to managed file copy operations when necessary.

    The module exports a single cmdlet:
    - Copy-FileEx: Copies files with advanced progress reporting

FEATURES
    * Windows API Integration
      - Uses CopyFileEx for optimal performance
      - Automatic fallback to managed copy
      - Configurable via UseWinApi parameter

    * Advanced Progress Reporting
      - Current speed with rolling average
      - Total progress for multiple files
      - Individual file progress
      - Detailed status messages

    * File Operation Support
      - Single file copy
      - Directory copy
      - Recursive operations
      - Wildcard support

EXAMPLES
    Copy a single file:
        Copy-FileEx -Path "C:\source\file.txt" -Destination "D:\backup"

    Copy with overwrite:
        Copy-FileEx -Path "C:\source\file.txt" -Destination "D:\backup" -Force

    Recursive directory copy:
        Copy-FileEx -Path "C:\source\folder" -Destination "D:\backup" -Recurse

    Copy multiple files:
        Copy-FileEx -Path "C:\source\*.txt" -Destination "D:\backup"

    Pipeline usage:
        Get-ChildItem "C:\source" -Filter "*.txt" | Copy-FileEx -Destination "D:\backup"

    Use managed copy method:
        Copy-FileEx -Path "C:\source\file.txt" -Destination "D:\backup" -UseWinApi $false

NOTES
    Performance Considerations:
    - Windows API method is generally faster
    - Large files benefit from API buffering
    - Network paths use compressed traffic when possible
    - Progress reporting has minimal overhead

    Safety Notes:
    - Always specify -Force to overwrite
    - Use LiteralPath for special characters
    - Check verbose output for detailed operations
    - Test recursive operations on small directories first

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If copies fail:
    1. Check file/folder permissions
    2. Verify paths are accessible
    3. Try with -UseWinApi $false
    4. Use -Verbose for detailed logging
    5. Check for file locks or access issues
